# Bioinformatics 2023 - Practice

This repository contains the material for the practical part of the course Bioinformatics 2023 (Department of Computer Science, University of Milan).
All the lessons are prepared using R Notebooks, which are R markdown documents having blocks of code that can be executed.
For more information about R Notebooks: [read this](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/notebook.html).

To use notebooks, it is necessary to have installed R and Rstudio.
Once the installation is performed, you can open notebooks using Rstudio. Both R markdown files (.Rmd) and 
html notebook (.nb.html) can run code in Rstudio.

At the beginning of each notebook there is the code to install required packages from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) 
and [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/).
