This repository contains the material for the practical part of the course Bioinformatics 2023 (Department of Computer Science, University of Milan).
All the lessons are prepared using R Notebooks, which are R markdown documents having blocks of code that can be executed.
For more information about R Notebooks: [read this](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/notebook.html).

To use notebooks, it is necessary to have installed R and Rstudio. All code was tested using R version 4.1.1 (2021-08-10) -- "Kick Things".
Once the installation is performed, you can open notebooks using Rstudio. Both R markdown files (.Rmd) and 
html notebook (.nb.html) can run code in Rstudio, however html notebooks can be also viewed on your browser.

At the beginning of each notebook there is the code to install required packages from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) 
and [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/).

If you have any problem with this code you can open a github issue or, in case of students of the course, you can drop me a 
message to my university e-mail.
